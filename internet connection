enter raspberry terminal using ssh (preferably using ethernet) 

change dhcpcd.conf in etc using

sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

so last lines look like:

interface eth0
#static ip_address=172.20.20.20/20
#static routers=172.20.20.20
#static domain_name_server=1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8

Ctrl+X - save the file 

(you can as well copy the file to same another name and create new one without those lines commented with #)

reboot Raspberry
sudo reboot

On Windows PC:
connect PC to WiFi
Control Panel
Networks and sharing
click [name of Wifi network]
click Properities
open "Sharing" tab
"Allow other users ... share this ethernet connection using:" 
Home internet connection - choose -     "ethernet"
OK


Open command prompt (cmd) and type "ipconfig"

You can openit using Win+R and enter "cmd" + OK

look after
and 
IPv4 Address
( in this case 192.168.137.1 )

Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::e52a:afd:b823:55ae%7
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.137.1 
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :

Download Advanced IP scanner

open it and in the search field enter range of the IP searching
( in this case: 192.168.137.0 - 192.168.137.255 )

click Scan

look after raspberrypi
check it's IP
( right click -> copy -> IP )

Connect to Raspberry using SSH with this IP
( in this case 192.168.137.11 )

You now have internet access on raspberry and you can update server, raspberry etc.
You can confirm this entering "sudo apt update" or "ping google.com"
   
After you will be done change dhcpcd.conf to previous state

sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

so last lines look like:

interface eth0
static ip_address=172.20.20.20/20
static routers=172.20.20.20
static domain_name_server=1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8

save with Ctrl+X

reboot raspberry
sudo reboot

Disable internet sharing on your PC unchecking the option "Allow other devices to share this internet connection"

You may have to unplug the ethernet cable from raspberry for few seconds and plug it again.

You can confirm that raspberry acts like access point again entering "ipconfig" on PC in cmd and check if IPv4 Address looks like 172.20.20.XX
